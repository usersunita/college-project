            <h4>Trip to Pathabhara</h4>
            <p>There is a belief that a pilgrimage to the mountain-top shrine of Pathibhara is all it takes to have oneâ€™s wish
             granted by the gods. However, there is also a belief that if the journey is too easy,
              the blessing may not be granted.
